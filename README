----

vim-twitter is being made simply as an excuse for me to work on vimilicious (http://github.com/remi/vimilicious)

Then, add these lines to your .vimrc

  ruby require 'rubygems'
  ruby require 'vim-twitter'

-----

  :Tweets            # shows recent tweets from friends
  :Tweet 'hello!'    # tweets
